## Some Format Requirements
	- **Class** should be wrapped with `[[]]`
	- **Method** should be referenced by `(())` (Block Refernece)
	- To keep the document easy to read, remenber to **fold all the sublists after editing**.
	- **Language is unlimited !** But English is recommended.
	- If you think you find a **bug**, add a `#FIXME` tag.
	- Template: [[ActionExtMove]]
## Attentions
	- Logseq's block edit logic is quite weird, try to get used to it.
	- css is customized by _stardust_, and is not stable currently. If you don't like it, just search `css` and delete everything in `custom.css`.
	- Install [Iosevka Curly](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/releases/download/v9.0.1/super-ttc-sgr-iosevka-curly-9.0.1.zip) to get better performance.
